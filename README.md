# Speech Data Analysis Methodology to Diagnose Parkinson Using Various ML Algorithms   
                       
                    
In this study, we will analyze the patients’ data who are diagnosed with the disease. Using speech data from subjects is expected to help the development of a noninvasive diagnostic. People with Parkinsonism (PWP) suffer from speech impairments like dysphonia (defective use of the voice), hypophonia (reduced volume), monotone (reduced pitch range), and dysarthria (difficulty with articulation of sounds or syllables). Therefore, our analysis in this project will be based on voice parameters of the affected.        
                  
# Data                      
     
The dataset was created by Athanasios Tsanas and Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with 10 medical centers in the US and Intel Corporation who developed the tele-monitoring device to record the speech signals. 
 
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson’s disease recruited to a six-month trial of a tele-monitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient’s homes.  

Columns in the dataset contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores (‘motor_UPDRS’ and ‘total_UPDRS’) from the 16 voice measures. The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around 200 recordings per patient, the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

# Data Cleaning and Outlier Removal

Our first step is going through the dataset and identify any missing value or outlier to take necessary measures. This step is essential to prepare the data for fruitful analysis. There are no missing values in our dataset.

Correlations between the variables

We can see that all the jitter variables highly correlate with Shimmer variables.


# Outlier Detection
In this section we will look at some of the significant features and check if there are outliers available.

# Dimensionality Reduction:
Our next step is dimensionality reduction. The dataset is very large with 22 variables and some of the variables have high correlations between them. So we are expecting to reduce the number of dimensions for better interpretation of the data.

Multi-dimensional scaling

First we try Multi-dimensional scaling which can help us visualizing the variable relationships in 2D graphs.

![43225541-fba3ee1a-901e-11e8-8bca-976efb614e25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88687718/182142379-422cfe9d-3a88-4595-8308-e45ce4d199eb.png)


The MDS plot clearly shows that age is creating a deviation between the datasets with female on the right and male on the left #this significant deviation is because the voice pictch, frequency and amplitude totally differs by being in different ranges for different genders.

Criterion 1 and criterion 2 suggests that the first two coordinates can represents majority of the data points since the cummulative proportion is above the threshold value of 0.8. Hence the MDS plot can be on a 2D scatterplot

![43225634-42b1b04e-901f-11e8-9fe6-5592c17da6b5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88687718/182142445-9050d44e-47c0-4d60-b13a-53bf0cce30df.png)


Below are the findings from multidimensional scaling on the parkinsons data:

The statitical technique of multi dimensional scaling through this plot has confirmed that attributes form groups with similar patterns 1. All jitter variables follow a pattern 2. All Shimmer variables follow a patter 3. PPE and NHR form a pattern 4. total UPDRS and motor UPDRS form a pattern 5. test time and sex form a pattern 6. Age contributes as a seperate attribute to the variation in data 7. HNR contributes as a seperate attribute to the variation in data

These findings can be logically understood as

Jitter is related to frequency measure so they form a pattern and it is logically valid
Shimmer is related to amplitude measure so they form a pattern and it is logically valid
Pitch of voice cord and noise to harmonics ratio are having an underlying relationship and that is observable through this finding
Motor UPDRS score is impacting the total score and it makes sense
Test time and sex are two independent factors and they are showing correlation by coincidence and this inference can be ignored
Age contributes as a seperate attribute to the variation in data
HNR contributes as a seperate attribute to the variation in data
Feature Selection with Random forest
To confirm that the observations in the multi dimensional scaling can be used to better identify patients with disease and ideal measures to estimate progression of the disease and interpret the similarity between cetain measures let us apply another technique called random forests algorithm that uses gini index which is another way of measuring dissimilarity in the data like multi dimensional scaling.

Random forest helps in measuring and identifying the correct measure that can aid in differentiating the data and better differentiate patients and ranking the different variables by there contribution to the variance of the dataset and also on their significance in measuring progression of the disease.

 On applying random forest we can observe that certain attributes contribute higher to the split in the dataset i.e. certain observations help better in categorising patients based on UPDRS scores and contribute higher to disease progression or severity. below are some analysis on the output:

Exploratory Factor Analysis

First, when we try to do exploratory factor analysis with all the variables, the model doesn’t run. After some research we have come to the conclusion that due to high multicolinearity between some variables (specificaly jitter and shimmer), the algorithm is not converging. So we decided to reduce the values that have high correlation between them. From the correlation plot we can see that jitter and shimmer variables have high correlation (0.9+) between themselves. So we tried building the model with one jitter and one shimmer variable. From the random forest analysis, we saw that Jitter.Abs. and Shimmer.APQ11 have highest significance in their corresponding frequency and amplitude groups. So we took these 2 variables in the exploratory factor analysis. Also both the updrs variables have 0.9+ correlation between them. So we took one from that group too.

With the above mentioned variables we explored different number of factors. But if we take 2 or 3 factors then only 40-45% data is explained. Also the age, sex and test_time have very small factor coefficient and large (0.8+) uniqueness. If we have 5/6 factors then the uniqueness of these variables lessen but still they are greater than 0.7.

From 3 factor analysis we can see that jitter, shimmer, NHR, HNR, RPDE and PPE have higher coefficents with Factor 1. However, from the random forest analysis, we have seen that age and DFA are the most significant variables, which have really low coefficient in these analysis.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Next we try confirmatory factor analysis to compare if the results from EFA are correct.

model_2

Since age, sex have very high uniqueness, we didn’t include them in the model. Also NHR and HNR have high correlation (0.9), so we included one of them. By reducing the highly correlated and highly unique values we got only 6 variables. Then we tried exploratory factor analysis on them with 2 factors and found that shimmer, HNR and RPD have higher coefficients with factor 1. So we named factor 1 as amplitude. The jitter, DFA and PPE variables have higher coefficients with factor 2. So we named factor 2 as frequency. Next we tried to build the model for confirmatory factor analysis with these observations.

From the summary we can see that this model has GFI and AGFI index greater than 0.95, which indicates the model is good. SRMR is 0.032, which is less than 0.05. It also indicates that this is a good model.

However, we know age is the most significant variable to identify if a patient has parkinsons disease or not. It is the most important factor in calculating the updrs score that helps identifying parkinsons in a patient. But dimensionality reduction with factor analysis is not able to acknowledge age due to high uniqueness in the variable. Also high multicollinearity is another possible reason for which the factor analysis algorithm does not converge with all the variables of the dataset. So we can reach to the conclusion that exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis are not suitable dimensionality reduction techniques for this dataset.

Principal Component Analysis:
Next we try pca which can be a possible solution for the multi-collinearity problem.

Below are our findins from Principal Componenets Analysis:

Covariance Matrix Interpretation:
All of the variables showcase small magnitudes which can have positive or negative linear releationships.

# Correlation Matrix Interpretation

From the correlation matrix we have the following observatins:

Variable HNR which is the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice. This variable has an inverse releationship with all the variables.

Variables containing the word “Shimmer” have high positive correlation values with each other.

Variables containing the word “Jitter” have high positive correlation values with each other

High correlation values between variables containing the word Shimer with variables containing the word “Jitter”

The PPE variable represents a nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation. This variable has strong positive correlations with varaibles containing the word “jitters” or “Shimmers” and the variable RPDE. RPDE represents a nonlinear dynamical complexity measure.

“total_UPDRS” and “motor_UPDRS” showcase a strong positive correlation. Where, “total_UPDRS” represents clinician’s total UPDRS score and “motor_UPDRS” the clinician’s motor UPDRS score both, linearly interpolated.


# PCA Interpretation

The amount of components was determined according to the following rule. The total amount of variation that the components represent must be within 70% to 90%.
According to this parameter components 1 through 4 where selected. These components amount to a total of 76% of the total variation.


# Pros and Cons of the study

From our study on the dataset, we have come to the conclusion that age, sex, test-time and DFA are the variables that are most difficult to capture in a factor analysis model. Though we know from Random forest analysis and research papers that these variables are most significant in deciding the UPDRS score.

In PCA, the age variable has high coefficient in component 7. But if we consider principal components with 1+ standard deviation, we have to consider the first 5 components, discarding the 7th component. Accordingly, test time and DFA has high coefficient in 6th and 8th component.

The data has high correlation between the variable groups “Jitter” and “Shimmer” which caused problems related to multi-collinearity during the analysis.
Future study on the parkinsons dataset should include more detailed analysis on the above mentioned variables with high-uniqueness and how to tackle the issue.
